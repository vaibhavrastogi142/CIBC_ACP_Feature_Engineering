Employee - Customer Host,easy simple job  literally anybody could do it  not joking  they ll hire anyone (heck they hired me)  so just apply  you just say hi to customers and scan any un-bagged item as they leave the store  eat lunch  then go back to do the same thing  then you go home  done deal  not much too complain about other than the two big issues i ll list in the cons ,1,there are a few things i’d like to share with everyone  first about the impact of wal mart’s employees not following policy  i worked at the county wal mart in st  louis at this address  3270 telegraph rd  st  louis  mo 63125  customers were very entitled  especially old white people  every time i stopped an old white customer they would be surprised that i stopped them  they thought i was accusing them of stealing  i told them this is normal and i have to check everyone  they always would tell me that they've been going there for years and that it was not new  i said yea it's not new it's what they (wal mart) have always been doing    i realized that the customers were being honest when they said they have never been stopped and checked  this made me incredibly sad because it was pretty obvious it was white privilege  i didn't think wal mart had a problem like that  i'm a latino man by the way  i stopped colored people too and most were ready to be checked and knew they had to get ready  i thought they did this because it was normal for all customers to do this  but clearly it was because they were stopped and checked while the white customers and the older white customers were not stopped  this made me incredibly sad    i always did my best to treat everyone equally  what did i get in return? a lot of white customers get angry at me for doing my job  i'm glad i taught them a little bit about equality  but it seemed like i'm the only one trying to treat everyone equally  my co workers were white and didn't seem to notice what they were doing  i even asked them about the old white customers leaving the store without having their un bagged items checked and my co workers just let them leave not stopping to check them  there's something even sadder than that though    the way it works is that you're only stopped if you have items that aren't inside a wal mart bag  like paper towels  soda  big boxes  tvs  and anything not in a bag  the only bagged things that would get scanned are electronics like phones or if somehow you fit a ps4 inside a bag  so basically only un bagged items were scanned and checked  again anything not in a bag means you should be stopped and the item is scanned and so is your receipt     however  i noticed that some customers with items in a bag would take out the item even if it wasn't an electronic and hand it to me to scan  i always told them that i didn't need to check them since it was in a wal mart bag and not an electronic  i realized that they were used to taking out the item and having it scanned when they didn't need to  the people who did that were colored people  it seems like minorities were used to being treated that way while white customers were used to being treated another way  that's white privilege in a nutshell    it was depressing to see this  especially in a city (st  louis) that's already racially divided  wal mart should be working against racial division  not contributing to it  they don't realize they're even doing it  while i am angry with my co workers and wal mart i have to remind myself that white people aren't capable of seeing what their actions result in  they don’t experience the things that we minorities have experienced and continue to experience  wal mart needs to ask and then listen to their customers and employees who are minorities and implement those ideas and suggestions    i worked at ross dress for less just before joining wal mart and even they did better in terms of not racial profiling  i worked as loss prevention at ross  so i should know  i was surprised that wal mart had that sorta issue  but i shouldn’t have been  the ross i worked in was in the city and had many minorities and people of all backgrounds while the wal mart was in the county where mainly white people live  missouri as a whole is mainly white and the major cities have many minorities  but even in the city there is white privilege unfortunately    the second thing that bothered me was their initial response to covid 19  it seemed like good at first  but they were also blind on how ineffective their efforts were  since the customer hosts were near the door we had to clean and disinfect the carts as they came into the building  this was harder and exhausting to do compared to what we were doing before  but i was proud and happy to know that i’m keeping people safe by disinfecting the carts  it felt like i was part of the war effort just like the frontline health workers were    the thing was though  i was the only one disinfecting them properly  i disinfected the carts as they came into the building and made sure that customers never grabbed a cart i didn’t disinfect  i told the customers which ones were disinfected and not to grab the ones i didn’t do yet  this resulted in better interactions with customers  which is important to point out because retail workers are not treated with respect or gratitude in general    my co workers would do the same  at least for a while  then they would stop and just let the customers grab a cart and then disinfect the cart after the customer already touched them  it seemed like common sense was thrown out the window and the customers were needlessly put in danger  i continued to do the proper way to disinfect  which is to clean the handles before a customer touches it  it was hard and exhausting  but i was glad i got to protect my community from a virus that kills    i saw how other retail stores disinfected the carts by spraying the whole cart  at wal mart we only disinfected the handles and i wasn’t fast enough to do that and the whole cart  besides i would need a big sprayer not a little spray bottle to get the whole cart and do it quickly  you had to be fast to ensure no customer grabbed an infected cart and also since there were so many carts coming  i hope that wal mart has done a better job and has those big sprayers that disinfect the whole cart  but they’re still not enforcing facemasks    since i wanted to protect my own family and couldn’t risk getting infected myself i quit my job with wal mart  my family has asthma (including myself) and covid 19 attacks the lungs  it’s almost a death sentence  many customers passed by me and having to disinfect the carts meant a higher chance of catching it  it was a good easy job that paid fairly ($11 50)  but it wasn’t worth putting my family in danger  no job or wage or salary is worth that    i hope that they gain some common sense and also actually follow their own policies in terms of every customer (including white people) have to be stopped if they have an item not in a wal mart bag or is an electronic then have said item scanned and compared to the customer’s receipt  white people  no matter what age  should not be able to get around this policy if other races and ethnicities cannot  enough said  i hope enough is said at least ,0,,,,,,

wrong  they didn't pay me for two months afterward  and it took a great deal of work to get the wheels moving on that so i could get paid again as usual  this severely shook the confidence i had in them   another problem lies in whoever the gm is  my first one was very laid back   almost too much  but overall was a good guy  the next one was chock full of ambition to move up  and if his ambition meant driving his area managers into the ground? well  so be it  suddenly the plate that i had just begun to manage fairly well was overflowing with all sorts of additional duties and things we had to do during the week   even  at one point  a mandatory five day week when i was initially scheduled for four  this led to lots of make work items and area managers constantly running into each other  but the gm couldn't have cared any less if he tried  he had his ambitions and that was that    to go back to the headline  if you must work for walmart  do so in a place with a competitive job market  such as a major city or in an area where different employers compete over a limited labor market  if walmart is practically the only game in town  stay far away  the reason is simple  if they are in the former category  you'll have more leverage  and upper management will know this  and treat you accordingly  if the latter  walmart management assumes the attitude of ""well  where else are you going to go? we can do whatever we want to you "" (even a period of high turnover   which i have seen happen   does little to alter that overall attitude )",0,,,,,,
